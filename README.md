### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Wolfeiii. I am a Java Developer mostly making plugins for Swedish Servers. Most of my focus is in Minecraft for the most recent years.

My specialty is plugin developing, but learning C# for game developing.

[agoniamc.eu](https://agoniamc.eu) - My current main server, head of development and adminstrator,
[xfunserver.se](https://xfunserver.se) - Swedish Server that I manage.

Check out my pinned repos for some of my recent work.
